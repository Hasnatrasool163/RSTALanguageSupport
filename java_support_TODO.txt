***** Code Completion *****
1. Load less stuff on first scan of ClassFiles, lazy-load rest of stuff as
   needed (for member completion info, etc.). -- not possible/practical due to
   class file format?
2. Make "prefix" go more than "1 level deep" when getting completions at caret
   position.
3. Improve performance of first ctrl+space - have a "pre-load package list?"
4. Make pre-loading everything an option (vs. old behavior of just imports)
   instead of the only choice.
5. Java 7: add parsing support for auto-closable try-blocks.
6. Javadoc links: unqualified @see/@link tags should scan imports to identify
   the actual class being linked to.
